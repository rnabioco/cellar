Select your operating system.\nMacOS\nSelect the newest R version, download the .pkg file, then open and install.\nWindows\nSelect the base link, then click download to download the .exe file. Open this file to install R.\nLinux\nIf you are on linux, then follow the documentation for your linux OS.\nDownload compiler tools\nMacOS\nYou may need to install the xcode command line tools if a package requires compilation. Open the Terminal from /Applications/Utilities/ (or use the search tool to search for terminal)\nType the following into Terminal:\nxcode-select --install\nPress “Install” and verify installation by typing into terminal:\ngcc --version\nWhich should print something similar to this:\n#' gcc (GCC) 4.8.5\n#' Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n#' This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO\n#' warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nHere’s a youtube video explainer\nNext you need to install gfortran. Follow this link and go to the “INSTALL OS-SPECIFIC GFORTRAN BINARY” section. Select the download link based on your macOS version. This will supply an installer.\nWindows\nYou need to install Rtools from CRAN. Go to this link and download the exe installer for your OS: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/\nLinux\nYou probably have a compiler already?\nDownload Rstudio\nGo to the Rstudio website and download the installer for your OS.\nInstalling packages\nOnce you have R and Rstudio set up, open up rstudio, then we will install various packages.\nIn general there are 3 common places that you can get R packages from:\nCRAN, this is the official R package repository. CRAN has 16,000+ packages, including the tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) and Seurat. Packages are installed using the install.packages() function. A successful install only needs to be done once.\nIn your console execute the following:\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\ninstall.packages(\"Seurat\")\nTest package installation once complete by loading the package(s)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(Seurat)\nBioconductor, which generally has bioinformatics related packages, such as clustifyr, DESeq2, ComplexHeatmap, etc.\nTo install bioconductor packages you should use the CRAN package BiocManager. BiocManager has a function called install() to install bioconductor packages. For example to install clustifyr\ninstall.packages(\"BiocManager\")\nlibrary(BiocManager)\ninstall(\"clustifyr\")\n# or equivalently you could run BiocManager::install(\"clustifyr\")\nGithub hosts open-source code from millions of projects. R packages hosted on github can be installed using the remotes package. Presto or djvdj are examples of single cell RNA-seq analysis packages on github. You’ll need to find the organization name and the repository name on github to install.\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github('rnabioco/djvdj')\nremotes::install_github('immunogenomics/presto')\n\n\n\n",
