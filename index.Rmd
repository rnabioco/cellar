### **November 1st - 5th, 2021 **

4-day workshop covering methods used to analyze single cell RNA-seq data using R/RStudio. The course will be held in *person* on the Anschutz campus (Ed2N building P28-CTL-2201AB Computer Lab).

### **Prerequisites**

A basic understanding of the R programming language and a single cell RNA-seq dataset to analyze. Individuals without R experience will need to complete online courses suggested by instructors. The single cell RNA-seq dataset can be from a public resource, or private data from a lab on campus. The instructors will provide specific recommendations for preferred data formats, dataset size and complexity.
