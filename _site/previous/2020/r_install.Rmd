# Setting up your computer for using R/Rstudio


# Download R

Download R from CRAN. Go to the cran homepage https://cran.r-project.org/. Select the operating system. 

## MacOS

Select the newest R version, download the `.pkg file, then open and install. 


## Windows

Select the `base` link, then click download to download the `.exe` file. Open this file to install R. Rui Fu has the most experience with windows. 

## Linux

If you are on linux, then follow the documentation for your linux OS. Ryan Sheridan is the resident linux expert. 
  
# Download compiler tools  

## MacOS

You need to install the xcode command line tools. Open the Terminal from `/Applications/Utilities/` (or use the search tool to search for terminal)
     
Type the following into Terminal: 

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

Press “Install” and verify installation by typing into terminal:

```bash
gcc --version
```
Here's a [youtube video explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z01lzHNrSdU&feature=emb_title) 
    
Next you need to install `gfortran`. Follow this [link](https://thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/cpp/r-compiler-tools-for-rcpp-on-macos/) and go to the "INSTALL OS-SPECIFIC GFORTRAN BINARY" section. Select the download link based on your macOS version. This will supply an installer. 
    
## Windows

You need to install `Rtools` from CRAN. Go to this link and download the exe installer for your OS: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
     
     
## Linux
  You probably have a compiler already?
  
# Download Rstudio

Go to the [Rstudio website](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) and download the installer for your OS. 

# Installing packages

Once you have R and Rstudio set up, open up rstudio, then we will install various packages. 

In general there are 3 common places that you can get R packages from:

1) CRAN, this is the official R package repository. CRAN has 16,000+  packages, including the tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) and Seurat. Packages are installed using the `install.packages()` function. A successful install only needs to be done once. 

```r
install.packages("Seurat")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Test your installs by loading the package(s)

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(Seurat)
```

2) [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/), which generally has bioinformatics related packages, such as clustifyr, DESeq2, ComplexHeatmap, etc.

To install you should use the CRAN `BiocManager`. For example to install `clustifyyr`

```r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("clustifyr")
BiocManager::install("ComplexHeatmap")
```

3) [Github](https://github.com/) host open-source code from millions of projects. R packages hosted on github can be installed using the `remotes` package. Presto or djvdj are examples of packages on github. You'll need to find the organization name and the package name on github to install. 

```#install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github('rnabioco/djvdj')
remotes::install_github('immunogenomics/presto')
```
